## Raspberry Pi time lapse camera

Use a battery pack like

A USB wireless adapter like

## Favorite restaurant real-life tagging

You read an article that mentions a restaurant, location, festival etc and you 
want to save it for future reference. When you're looking for somewhere to do
it can start suggesting places that you've already tagged in your list. 

It could also detect that you're close to an already tagged location and it could
suggest whether you want to go visit it.

When you're out walking, you might see something that catches your attention and 
you just take a photograph or tag the location and the tool knows to search and
fetch the possible things that you were interested in and allows you to save them
in your list.

## Personal productivity monitor

A tool that keeps track of how you use you computer. It can record keystrokes,
time spent in differnt applications, number of emails sent/received, idle time,
etc to provide you with ways to improve your productivity.

## Raspberry Pi NAS media centre

Hook the Pi up to a TV and your movie collection and stream it over the network.

## Arduino front door card reader

Use any RFID card like a tube pass for getting in and out of your home. When a
guest needs access you just program their card and they can get in your house
without you needing to be present to let them in or to hand over a key.
